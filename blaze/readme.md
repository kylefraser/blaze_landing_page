# BLAZE
This was a project done during my time at Startup Institute. We had an idea hack moderated by TOM HUGHES, where we were broken up into teams of 5 and tasked to come up with an app concept. Our team came up with "BLAZE" an interactive community driven hiking application. I was tasked with the DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT of the landing page. We only had 3 hours to complete this.
